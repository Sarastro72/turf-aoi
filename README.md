Turf - Area of influence
============

This project aims to visualize turf game zones (http://turfgame.com) as player
areas of influence overlaid on a real world map.


###TODO:
- Search function (zone name, location)  _partially fixed_
- Player info panel (player, color on map, # zones on map)
- ~~Take feed panel~~
- ~~Adapt UI for small mobile devices~~
- ~~Auto update on zone takes~~
- ~~Show the name of the selected player~~
- ~~Faster zone info on mouse over~~
- ~~Remove XSS limitation~~
- ~~Show players on map~~
- ~~Highlight selected players zones~~
- ~~Borders between players zones~~

###Known issues:
- Players sometimes pops out of existence shortly after having been loaded
- Issues if scrolling when players/zones are updated
