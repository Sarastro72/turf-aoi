Turf - Area of influence
============

This project aims to visualize turf game zones (http://turfgame.com) as player
areas of influence overlaid on a real world map.


###TODO:
- Search function (zone name, location)  _partially fixed_
- Player info panel (player, color on map, # zones on map)
- Show the name of the selected player
- Remove XSS limitation
- Faster zone info on mouse over
- Auto update on zone takes
- ~~Show players on map~~
- ~~Highlight selected players zones~~
- ~~Borders between players zones~~

###Known issues:
- Players sometimes pops out of existence shortly after having been loaded
